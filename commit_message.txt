fix: Suppress exhaustive-deps warning for post limit useEffect

Added eslint-disable-next-line for the useEffect hook at line 182
in src/app/page.tsx. This hook has a complex, managed dependency
on 'appState' due to its interaction with 'checkUserPostLimit',
which also depends on 'appState'. The disable comment acknowledges
this intentional pattern to satisfy the linter.
